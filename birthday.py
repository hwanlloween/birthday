#feat : hereâ€™s the entire code for calculating the probability of at least one birthday coincidence in a group of 23 people:

#This code have 4 steps to approach the result

#Generating random birthdays (step 1)
#Checking if a list of birthdays has coincidences (step 2)
#Performing multiple trials (step 3)
#Calculating the probability estimate (step 4)
